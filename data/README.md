Data from direct numerical simulations of the tKdV equation in different statistical regimes:

* 'tKdV_J32th10': model with truncation size $J=32$ and inverse temperature $\theta = -0.1$, showing near-Gaussian statistics in solution;
* 'tKdV_J32th50': model with truncation size $J=32$ and inverse temperature $\theta = -0.5$, showing highly skewed statistics in solution;
